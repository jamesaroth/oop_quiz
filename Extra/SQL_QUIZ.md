# Quiz 3: SQL + Python

For today's quiz, you've been given a `.csv` file that you need to transfer into a database. Using a python script, transfer the attached `csv` into a sqlite database.

* You should set up a `schema.py` file to create the database, and it have the exact same structure (columns and name) as the original file.

* You may use ONLY core python and the sqlite library (no `pandas.to_sql()`, that would be too easy)

* As always, no talking to each other. You may ask your instructors questions if you have them, and use any old code or the internet that might help you.

Submit a `.zip` file with your `schema.py`, `seed.py` (or whatever you call your python script), and your database file by 11:00.
